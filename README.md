# Codeforces Solutions

you can find solutions for CF problemsets, starting from most solved questions to harder and less solved questions.
## Alternatives
you can also follow your favorite programmer in CF and check his codes for every contest he take place. this can be a really good learning material.
## Future
### Other Programming Languages
I am going to add C++ and Python code for every (good enough) problem. Other Languages are welcome to added.

### Testcases
I am trying to generate or find testcases or codes that generate testcase for every question. this is usefull when you want to add CF problems to your locally native-language judge.
